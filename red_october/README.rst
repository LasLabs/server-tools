=======================
Red October Attachments
=======================

This module provides a ``red_october`` type to ``ir.attachment``, which provides
encryption and decryption services using a remote Red October instance.

It also provides a field that uses this attachment type, similar to a Binary field.


Installation
============

A working Red October installation is required to use this module.

* Install the Python Red October library ``pip install git+https://github.com/LasLabs/python-red-october``

Configuration
=============

* Go to ``Settings => Crypto => Vaults`` to create and manage vaults.
  * Vault must be initialized in ``Action => Init Vault`` from vault form view.
* Manage crypto users in ``Settings => Crypto => Vaults``.

Usage
=====

* Create an Attachment of Type ``Red October``.
* Manage delegations in ``Settings => Crypto => Delegations``.

Note that there must be a valid rights delegation on the Vault in order to decrypt a file,
even if you are the only owner.

Developers looking to implement this functionality should use an ``ir.attachment``
field set to type ``red_october``.
